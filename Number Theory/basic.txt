in a 4 bit memory system, total choices are 2^4, but
binary representation of 16 - 10000 , which contain 5 bit,so maximum number stored in a 4 bit memory system is-2^4-1
so in a 32 bit memory system maximum number stored is - 2^32-1
but int contains maximum number as 2^31-1, as 1st bit is used for sign convention,
while unsigned int contains maximum number as 2^32-1.

In a binary representation 1 is known as set bit while 0 is known as unset bit.
and indexing start from rightmost side, same as the array 
rightmost bit is known as least significant bit while leftmost bit is known as most significant bit.



*********IMPORTANT***************
Given any integer x, we can see that its lowest significant bit is a divisor of x
If x has more than one bit, we can repeatedly subtract the value corresponding to the lowest significant bit of x.
When x finally has only one bit, finish the first step. In this step, we have only used each significant bit of x at most once.
